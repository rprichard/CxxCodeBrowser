HISTORY
-------

 - Try to reduce the number of history entries.
    - Certain kinds of successive location changes could be collapsed into a
      single navigation.  (e.g. searching with the GotoWindow, selecting files,
      selecting refs.)
    - Moving to a different position could mutate the history entry rather
      than create a new entry.  (e.g. If I navigate to a function definition,
      then scroll up, we want to record the position I scrolled to and forget
      the position I jumped to.)  -- But what if I scroll to a totally
      different part of the file?
    - I suspect getting this aspect of history right is going to require some
      careful thinking about what users expect Back/Forward to take them to.
    - I think good Back/Forward behavior requires that users can predict/control
      what the buttons do.
    - CRAZY IDEA: Show a "history bar" at the top of the window:
          [File1.cc] >> [File2.cc] >> [File3.cc]
      Highlight the current entry.  Clicking an entry brings you to that entry.
      As you scroll, the current entry changes.
      Pro: Makes it really obvious what's going on with the history.
      Con: Is it worth the real-estate?
      Navigating with GotoWindow would create a new "temp" history entry.
      Dismissing the dialog would destroy the "temp" entry and send the user
      back.

 - Figure out the relationship between the History, History::Location,
   MainWindow, and SourceWidget classes.  Details:
    - History::Location cannot be called {File,Source}Location because that
      suggests line and column.  History::Location is really a GUI location.
      Maybe it could be a child of SourceWidget.
    - The toolbar Back/Forward buttons need Enabled bits pushed to them.
    - The context menu Back/Forward buttons can pull Enabled bits.
    - Idea:
       - Consolidate more navigation policy in the History class.  The History
         class needs to know when the SourceWidget location changes due to the
         user scrolling.  It should also know, for each jump, which window
         (or at least what kind of window) initiated the jump.
       - The history window can have a "historyChanged" signal that the
         MainWindow uses to update its Back/Forward toolbar buttons.
    - Wait: shouldn't pressing Escape in the GotoWindow send the user back to
      where they came from?  I think this is going to be a general problem with
      search features.


FILE NAVIGATION
---------------

 - The ReportFileList is too limited.  It's bad at browing files and getting to
   a specific file.

IDEA: Have a tree to the left of the SourceWidget showing:
 (1) All files in the project root directory
 (2) A sparse tree of all files outside the tree that are part of the index
 - Autoexpand and autocollapse directories when a file is shown, but keep track
   of directories that the user has manually expanded.  Clear that directory if
   the user manually collapses it.
 - Clicking anywhere on the directory name should toggle it.
 - The current SourceWidget file and the selected file are always matched.  A
   directory is never selected, and the tree never has keyboard focus.

IDEA: Make ReportFileList hierarchical.
IDEA: Need a way to filter/fuzzy-search for files/directories.
IDEA: Create a GotoWindow-variant that works with files instead of symbols.


SYMBOL NAVIGATION
-----------------

 - We need a fast replacement for "xref <symbol>".  My original idea was that
   Ctrl+X would bring up a "Cross-reference symbol..." popup instead of a
   "Go to symbol..." popup.  (Maybe if one of the popups is open, you could
   switch it to the other by hitting Ctrl+S/Ctrl+X?)

 - If there are multiple definitions of one symbol, there needs to be some way
   to navigate to each of them.  For example, we might want to expand c:@F@main
   into each definition of c:@F@main.

   PROBLEM: If there is one definition of c:@F@main, then we ignore any
   declarations.  If the definition is gone, though, are we supposed to show all
   the declarations?  That's really inconsistent.  What if there is no
   definition but one declaration?

   PROBLEM: It makes no sense to show things like namespace declarations.  Same
   goes for forward declarations of classes.  Local variables and parameters
   probably shouldn't be in the GotoWindow either.

   IDEA: Maybe we severely restrict the kinds of symbols you can goto.  We only
   want to goto things that are likely to be defined in one place:
    - Function definitions (i.e. bodies)
    - Class/struct/union definitions
    - Members
    - Variable definitions (excluding params, locals, and mere declarations)

   IDEA: Maybe the above class of things is expanded into refs, while other
   symbols are not expanded.  In GotoWindow, hitting Enter on a ref shows you
   the symbol.  Hitting Enter on a mere symbol shows the cross-reference window.
   Hitting Shift-Enter always shows the cross-reference window?
