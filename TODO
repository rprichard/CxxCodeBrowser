Experiment with indexing other large projects:
 * Linux kernel
 * X.org
 * Firefox
 * Chromium
 * LibreOffice

Make click and right-click do the "right" thing" in the SourceWidget.  I need
the ability to click on identifiers/lines/characters to navigate.

Improve the indexing:
 * We need to differentiate between declarations and definitions for functions
   and structs/classes.
 * Calls seem to be turned into three xrefs: CallExpr, DeclRefExpr, and
   UnexposedExpr.  There should be only one.
 * The definition of a constructor, Foo::Foo, generates three references:
    - A TypeRef for the first Foo.
    - A TypeRef and a CXXConstructor for the second Foo.  This second TypeRef
      reference is inconvenient.
 * Maybe it'd be nice if each USR had a more user-friendly name?  I'm not sure
   this really works.  I've noticed that some USRs are extremely long, so they
   will have to be truncated when displayed.
 * Maybe we could get kind information on the symbols themselves, not just on
   the xrefs?

Things need to be sorted:
 * References in the xref window need to be sorted by either
   (file, line, column) or by kind.  Right now, sorting by one category leaves
   the entries in an arbitrary order w.r.t. the other categories.
 * Right-clicking an identifier shows symbols in arbitrary order, AFAIK.

Show a count of items in the TreeReportWindow.

The TreeReportWindow is frequently too narrow to hold references.  A big part
of the problem is that a complete path is displayed.  Maybe we can make the
path shorter like so:
 - When the path is a child of the project root (e.g. /home/rprichard/llvm),
   then use a relative path (e.g. include/llvm/Pass.h), but use an absolute
   path otherwise.
 - This isn't quite right when there are directories like
   /home/rprichard/llvm-build that contain auto-generated code.
 - One fix is to make /home/rprichard the project root.
 - This is probably the best solution.
 - A more complicated idea:  Recognize that there are certain "domains"(?) in
   the filesystem (e.g. /, /usr, /opt, $HOME), and /home/rprichard/llvm and
   /home/rprichard are in the same $HOME domain, and since $PROJECT_ROOT is
   /home/rprichard/llvm, use a ../llvm-build relative path to refer to that
   directory.  Use absolute paths for things like /usr/include/stdio.h.

It'd be nice if the line/column/type columns of the xref window were not
resizable.

Does #ifdef FOO create a reference to FOO?  I think it should.

Built-in macro definitions ought to be recorded somehow.

The line "#define F(x) G(x)" isn't recording an expansion of G even when F is
expanded.

Ubiquitous Ctrl-F (source widget and tree report window)

A "grep" feature.

Some way to see the files that *aren't* C/C++ source code.  e.g. build files,
READMEs, etc.  Maybe use a tree for the files instead of a table?

Syntax highlighting.

BUG: I see some files in the Mozilla index that have .. components in them
(e.g. mozilla-central/obj-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/toolkit/mozapps/update/updater/../../../../xpcom/build/nsVersionComparator.cpp)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main window improvements:

 * Show the name of the current file.

 * History (Alt-Left / Alt-Right).

 * Allow clicking on symbols.  The user clicks a character.  What happens?
   Two obvious approaches:
    - Look for a Ref containing the clicked-on character.  Go to that Ref's
      single definition.
       - Problem: there can be multiple Refs on a single character.
       - Problem: what about multiple definitions?
    - Look left and right to find a containing identifier, then search for any
      kind of symbol.
       - Problem: Consider C++ namespaces.  What if the user clicks on the Bar
         in "Foo::Bar".  Does the navigator need to understand how :: affects
         C++ identifiers and lookup "Foo::Bar" or does it look for "Bar"?
   I think the first approach is the right one.

New commands:

 * Go to file.

 * Go to symbol.

 * Browse all included files.

Indexing / modeling:

 * Figure out how the SourceLocation type works.  I noticed some filenames
   that were blank, and I noticed that "G" had no Usage reg in the test
   case:
      #define G(x) x * 2
      #define F(x) G(x)
      int main() {
         return F(1);
      }
   I suspect that preprocessor expansion is affecting things somehow.  I
   need to understand how the "spelling location" vs other location types
   works.

 * Deal with the <built-in> file.  Maybe it'd be cool if you could browse
   to that file somehow?  (Similarly, should the includes and extraargs
   be displayed for the translation units?)

 * Record the include graph.  What if file A.c includes X.h several times?
   More typically, A.c and B.c will both include X.h.  What's the best
   way to show the graph?  There's already a generalized table widget.
   Should there be a generalized tree widget?

 * Actually parse the C/C++ AST and index more kinds of symbols.  Symbol
   namespaces are going to become interesting, I think:
    - preprocessor macros
    - class/struct/union/enum names
    - enumerators
    - C++ namespaces

 * For a Ref, save a starting and ending column rather than just a start
   column?  (e.g.: Suppose I have a "foobar" field that's referenced inside
   an expansion of the FOO macro.  The GUI will want to know what to
   highlight, which is probably just FOO.)
